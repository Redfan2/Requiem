     * <strong>WARNING</strong>: suppressing the possession attempt on a client world
     * (by returning {@code DENY} or {@code HANDLED}) can cause major desynchronization issues.
     * <p>
     * Returning {@code PASS} lets processing continue as normal,
     * calling the next listener. If no callback handles the attempt, the result depends on the logical side.
     * On a client world, the possession attempt will be allowed by default. On a server world, it will be rejected.

     * If <code>simulate</code> is true, the attempt is simulated.
     * When the attempt is simulated, the state of the game should <strong>NOT</strong> be altered by any listener.
     * This means that this method is effectively pure during simulated possession attempts,
     * in the following sense:
     * <em>If its return value is not used, removing its invocation won't
     * affect program state and change the semantics. Exception throwing is not considered to be a side effect.</em>
